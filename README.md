# Implementation of Personalized Demand Response (DR) Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Personalized Demand Response (DR) Recommendation System. The system leverages various data analysis and machine learning techniques to provide customized DR strategies for energy consumption optimization.

Use Case: ML algorithms can analyze individual energy consumption patterns to provide personalized recommendations for energy reduction during DR events.

Benefits: Tailored recommendations can improve participant engagement by showing them the most effective ways to reduce their energy usage, based on their habits and the devices they use.

## Features
- Data loading, preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
- Implementation of predictive models
- Implementation of DR recommendations
- Visualization tools for data and recommendation insights
